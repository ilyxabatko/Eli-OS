# **Eli OS** is an operating system project written in Rust.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to get familiar with OS development basics and implement a simple operating system (kernel level) that can be run on real hardware.

The goal is pretty much achieved by following the [Rust OS Guide](https://os.phil-opp.com/) and having a simple kernel that can be run in Qemu with the ability to test it, have some output to the host machine.
